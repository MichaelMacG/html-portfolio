<h1>Movies That I Love</h1>
<h2>No particular order, they're all Brilliant!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>One boy and his dog</h3>
<p>Post-apocalyptic and one of my favourite movies growing up. Definitely weird in places and is listed as a cult classic. 
   Without spoiling the movie it's essentially based on the world being nuked, with a few human survivors and loads of 
   mutants/ cannibals running around trying to eat the main hero and his telepathic dog.
</p>
<p> In my opinion the dog is the main hero, due to it's heightened senses it can smell these cannibals from miles away and is 
    constantly saving the human boy from certain death.</p>
<h3>The Last Samurai</h3>
<p>I've always been a fan of movies involving the far east, whether it be Chinese subbed martial art movies or amazing 
    Anime's. This captured a period of history I was fascinated with, just after the American Civil war and captured brilliantly
    the dying age of the Samurai. Controversial choice I know, as a lot of people i've mentioned this movie to have let me 
    know they thought it was absolute rubbish, but I love it, so their opinion is void.</p>
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>One of the first Anime movie's I watched as a kid, and I must have seen it well over 50 times, probably more. This sparked my
   love of Anime movies and to this day I still think it's a masterpiece.</p>
<h3>Red Cliff</h3>  
<p>Based on the battle of Red Cliffs, this is an amazing movie. Honestly one my favourite martial arts/war movies of all time.
   The story is beautifully done and the scenes and the whole movie is nothing short of epic. Only ever watched the subbed 
   version as I refuse to watch dubbed versions because I find the dubbed voices never really hold a candle to the originals.</p>
